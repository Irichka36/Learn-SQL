Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".

Hint:
An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

user_actions Table:
Column Name	  Type
user_id	      integer
event_id	    integer
event_type	  string ("sign-in, "like", "comment")
event_date	  datetime

WITH active_users_june AS (
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT user_id
    , EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) AS month
  FROM user_actions
  WHERE 
    (event_type = 'sign-in'
    OR event_type = 'like'
    OR event_type = 'comment')
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) = 06
  GROUP BY 1,2
)
, active_users_july AS (
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT user_id
    , EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) AS month
  FROM user_actions
  WHERE 
    (event_type = 'sign-in'
    OR event_type = 'like'
    OR event_type = 'comment')
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) = 07
  GROUP BY 1,2
)

SELECT 
  aujl.month
  , COUNT (*) AS monthly_active_users
FROM active_users_july AS aujl
JOIN active_users_june AS aujn ON aujl.user_id = aujn.user_id
GROUP BY 1;
