Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:
Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

events Table:
Column Name	    Type
app_id	        integer
event_type	    string
timestamp	      datetime

WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    app_id
    , COUNT (CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 END) AS nmb_clicks
    , COUNT (CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 END) AS nmb_impr
  FROM events
  WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM timestamp) = 2022
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    app_id
    , ROUND (100.0 * nmb_clicks / nmb_impr, 2) AS ctr
FROM cte;
