which sold between 100,000 units and 105,000 units
AND were manufactured by either Biogen, AbbVie, or Eli Lilly
Output the manufacturer name, drug name, and the # of units sold.

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	      Type

units_sold	      integer
total_sales	      decimal
cogs	            decimal
manufacturer	    varchar

SELECT 
manufacturer
, drug
, units_sold 
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE 
units_sold BETWEEN 100000 AND 105000
AND (manufacturer = 'Biogen' OR manufacturer = 'AbbVie' OR manufacturer = 'Eli Lilly');
