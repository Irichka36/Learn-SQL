Assume you're given the tables containing completed trade orders and user details in a Robinhood trading system.
Write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order. 
Output the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.

trades Table:
Column Name	    Type
order_id	      integer
user_id	        integer
quantity	      integer
status	        string ('Completed', 'Cancelled')
date	          timestamp
price	          decimal (5, 2)


users Table:
Column Name	  Type
user_id	      integer
city	        string
email	        string
signup_date	  datetime


WITH cte AS (
  SELECT  
  u.city AS city
  , t.order_id AS order
FROM trades t
JOIN users u ON u.user_id = t.user_id
WHERE t.status = 'Completed'
)
  SELECT 
    city
    , COUNT (*) AS total_orders
  FROM cte 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
