You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	        Type
item_count	        integer
order_occurrences	  integer


WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    item_count * order_occurrences AS count_items
    ,order_occurrences
  FROM items_per_order
  )
SELECT ROUND(CAST(SUM(count_items) / SUM(order_occurrences) AS numeric), 1) AS mean
FROM cte;
