Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category. 
Write a query using COUNT DISTINCT to identify the number of unique products within each product category.

product_spend Table:
Column Name	      Type
category	        string
product	          string
user_id	          integer
spend	            decimal
transaction_date	timestamp

SELECT 
  category
  , COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS count
FROM product_spend
GROUP BY category;
