Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. 
The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

product_spend Table:
Column Name	      Type
category	        string
product	          string
user_id	          integer
spend	            decimal
transaction_date	timestamp

WITH row_product AS (
  SELECT 
    category
    , product
    , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(spend) DESC) AS row_spend
    , SUM(spend) AS sum_spend
  FROM product_spend
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2022
  GROUP BY 1,2
)
SELECT 
  category
  , product
  , sum_spend
FROM row_product
WHERE row_spend IN (1,2)
ORDER BY category, row_spend;
