Assume you're given a table on Walmart user transactions. Based on their most recent transaction date, write a query that retrieve the users along with the number of products they bought.

Output the user's most recent transaction date, user ID, and the number of products, sorted in chronological order by the transaction date.

Starting from November 10th, 2022, the official solution was updated, and the expected output of transaction date, number of users, and number of products was changed to the current expected output.

user_transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
user_id	integer
spend	decimal
transaction_date	timestamp

WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    transaction_date
    , user_id
    , product_id
    , RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date DESC) AS rank_date
  FROM user_transactions
)
SELECT 
  transaction_date
  , user_id
  , COUNT(product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM cte 
WHERE rank_date = 1
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1 ASC;
