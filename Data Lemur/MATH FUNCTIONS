Imagine you are a Data Analyst working at CVS Pharmacy, and you had access to pharmacy sales data.
For all Merck drugs, output the drug name, and the unit cost for each drug, rounded up to the nearest dollar. Order it from cheapest to most expensive drug.
Hint: Unit cost is defined as the total sales divided by the units sold.

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	    Type
product_id	    integer
units_sold	    integer
total_sales	    decimal
cogs	          decimal
manufacturer	  varchar
drug	          varchar

SELECT 
  drug
  , CEILING(total_sales/units_sold) AS unit_cost
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE manufacturer = 'Merck'
ORDER BY 2;
