Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.
Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:
Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.

measurements Table:
Column Name	        Type
measurement_id	    integer
measurement_value	  decimal
measurement_time	  datetime

WITH cte AS (
  SELECT
  CAST(measurement_time AS DATE) AS measurement_day
  , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CAST(measurement_time AS DATE) ORDER BY measurement_time) AS measurement_rang
  , measurement_value
FROM measurements
)
SELECT 
  measurement_day
  , SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(measurement_rang AS INTEGER) % 2 = 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum  
  , SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(measurement_rang AS INTEGER) % 2 != 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum
FROM cte
GROUP BY measurement_day;
