QUESTION 1
CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.
Write a query to find the top 3 most profitable drugs sold, and how much profit they made. Assume that there are no ties in the profits. Display the result from the highest to the lowest total profit.

Definition:
cogs stands for Cost of Goods Sold which is the direct cost associated with producing the drug.
Total Profit = Total Sales - Cost of Goods Sold

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	      Type
product_id	      integer
units_sold	      integer
total_sales	      decimal
cogs	            decimal
manufacturer	    varchar
drug	            varchar

SELECT
  drug
  , total_sales - cogs AS total_profit
FROM pharmacy_sales
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;


QUESTION 2
Write a query to identify the manufacturers associated with the drugs that resulted in losses for CVS Health and calculate the total amount of losses incurred.
Output the manufacturer's name, the number of drugs associated with losses, and the total losses in absolute value. Display the results sorted in descending order with the highest losses displayed at the top.

WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    manufacturer
    , drug
    , total_sales - cogs AS total_profit
  FROM pharmacy_sales
  WHERE (total_sales - cogs) <= 0
)
  SELECT 
    manufacturer
    , COUNT(drug) AS drug_count
    , ABS(SUM(total_profit)) AS total_loss
  FROM cte
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 3 DESC;


QUESTION 3
Write a query to calculate the total drug sales for each manufacturer. Round the answer to the nearest million and report your results in descending order of total sales. 
In case of any duplicates, sort them alphabetically by the manufacturer name.
Since this data will be displayed on a dashboard viewed by business stakeholders, please format your results as follows: "$36 million".

SELECT
  manufacturer
  , CONCAT('$', ROUND(SUM (total_sales)/1000000.0),' ', 'million') AS sale
FROM pharmacy_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY SUM(total_sales) DESC, 1 ASC;
