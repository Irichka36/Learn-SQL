Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. 
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:
Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

activities Table
Column Name	    Type
activity_id	    integer
user_id	        integer
activity_type	  string ('send', 'open', 'chat')
time_spent	    float
activity_date	  datetime

age_breakdown Table:
Column Name	    Type
user_id	        integer
age_bucket	    string ('21-25', '26-30', '31-25')

WITH sum_time AS (
  SELECT 
    ab.age_bucket
    , SUM (CASE WHEN a.activity_type = 'open' THEN a.time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS sum_time_open
    , SUM (CASE WHEN a.activity_type = 'send' THEN a.time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS sum_time_send
  FROM activities a
  JOIN age_breakdown ab ON a.user_id = ab.user_id
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
  age_bucket 
  , ROUND ((sum_time_send/(sum_time_send + sum_time_open)) * 100.0,2) AS send_perc
  , ROUND ((sum_time_open/(sum_time_send + sum_time_open)) * 100.0,2) AS open_perc
FROM sum_time
ORDER BY 1 ASC;
