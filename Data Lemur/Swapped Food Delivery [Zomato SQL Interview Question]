Zomato is a leading online food delivery service that connects users with various restaurants and cuisines, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, and get meals delivered to their doorsteps.
Recently, Zomato encountered an issue with their delivery system. Due to an error in the delivery driver instructions, each item's order was swapped with the item in the subsequent row. 
As a data analyst, you're asked to correct this swapping error and return the proper pairing of order ID and item.

If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it should remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.

In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs and items.

orders Schema:
column_name	  type	    description
order_id	    integer	  The ID of each Zomato order.
item	        string	  The name of the food item in each order.

WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    order_id
    , item
    , COUNT(order_id) OVER () AS count_orders
  FROM orders
)
SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN order_id % 2 !=0 AND order_id != count_orders THEN (order_id + 1) 
    WHEN order_id % 2 = 0 AND order_id != count_orders THEN (order_id - 1)
    ELSE order_id
  END AS correct_order_id
  , item
FROM cte
ORDER BY correct_order_id;
