Assume there are three Spotify tables: artists, songs, and global_song_rank, which contain information about the artists, songs, and music charts, respectively.
Write a query to find the top 5 artists whose songs appear most frequently in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table. Display the top 5 artist names in ascending order, along with their song appearance ranking.
If two or more artists have the same number of song appearances, they should be assigned the same ranking, and the rank numbers should be continuous (i.e. 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5). 
If you've never seen a rank order like this before, do the rank window function tutorial.

artists Table:
Column Name	  Type
artist_id	    integer
artist_name	  varchar
label_owner	  varchar

songs Table:
Column Name	  Type
song_id	      integer
artist_id	    integer
name	        varchar

global_song_rank Table:
Column Name	Type
day	        integer (1-52)
song_id	    integer
rank	      integer (1-1,000,000)

WITH global_count AS (
SELECT 
  a.artist_name
  , DENSE_RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT (s.song_id) DESC) AS artist_rank
FROM artists a
JOIN songs s ON s.artist_id = a.artist_id
JOIN global_song_rank g ON s.song_id = g.song_id
WHERE g.rank <=10
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
  artist_name
  , artist_rank
FROM global_count
WHERE artist_rank <= 5;
