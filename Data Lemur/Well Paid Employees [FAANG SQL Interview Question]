Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.
As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

employee Schema:
column_name	      type	    description
employee_id	      integer	  The unique ID of the employee.
name	            string	  The name of the employee.
salary	          integer	  The salary of the employee.
department_id	    integer	  The department ID of the employee.
manager_id	      integer  	The manager ID of the employee.

SELECT 
  employee.employee_id
  , employee.name
FROM employee AS employee
JOIN employee AS manager ON employee.manager_id = manager.employee_id
WHERE 
  employee.employee_id != employee.manager_id
  AND employee.salary > manager.salary;
