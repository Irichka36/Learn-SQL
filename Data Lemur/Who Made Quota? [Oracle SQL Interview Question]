As a data analyst on the Oracle Sales Operations team, you are given a list of salespeopleâ€™s deals, and the annual quota they need to hit.
Write a query that outputs each employee id and whether they hit the quota or not ('yes' or 'no'). Order the results by employee id in ascending order.

Definitions:
deal_size: Deals acquired by a salesperson in the year. Each salesperson may have more than 1 deal.
quota: Total annual quota for each salesperson.

deals Table:
Column Name	      Type
employee_id	      integer
deal_size	        integer

sales_quotas Table:
Column Name	      Type
employee_id	      integer
quota	            integer


WITH employee_result AS (
  SELECT 
    d.employee_id
    , sq.quota
    , SUM(deal_size) AS sum_deal
  FROM deals d
  JOIN sales_quotas sq ON d.employee_id = sq.employee_id
  GROUP BY 1,2
) 
SELECT 
  employee_id
  , CASE WHEN sum_deal >= quota THEN 'yes' ELSE 'no' END
FROM employee_result
ORDER BY employee_id ASC;
