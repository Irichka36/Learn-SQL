Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. Write a query to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.
The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend and year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

user_transactions Table:
Column Name	      Type
transaction_id	  integer
product_id	      integer
spend	            decimal
transaction_date	datetime

WITH cte AS(
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year
    , product_id
    , SUM (spend) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date)) AS curr_sum_spend
    , LAG (spend,1) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date)) AS prev_sum_spend
 FROM user_transactions
  ORDER BY 2,1
)
  SELECT 
    year
    , product_id
    , curr_sum_spend
    , prev_sum_spend
    , ROUND(100.0 * (curr_sum_spend-prev_sum_spend)/prev_sum_spend,2) AS yoy_rate
